# About Us
TrickyTactics was founded in the midst of a deep void that plagued the auto battler genre. A community was in anguish over the loss of what could have been the next big auto chess titan from the makers of Brawl Stars and Clash of Clans: Clash Mini. From the ashes of one idea arose a new one: Why not make our own?
We weren’t just players – we were dedicated members of the  community who saw untapped potential in the auto-chess genre. Our team formed organically from community discussions, united by a shared vision: to create something special for players, by players.

> A Game for the Players, by the Players

This wasn’t just a tagline for us. Having been part of the community, we understood firsthand what worked and what needed improvement. Our team brought together content creators, strategy theorists, and passionate players who had spent countless hours analyzing every aspect of Autochess genre and game design as a whole.
We have encountered many obstacles along the way, such as the sudden transition from Unity to Godot, but together our team is able to overcome all of this, with your support of course.

## Creative Vision
We are creating  a game that is fair in all aspects, starting from fairness with minimal randomness in combat, ending with a monetization system that will not be punishing for F2P players, but still will feel beneficial for supporters.
From playing games to making them, we prioritize the player and player's feedback above everything else. Our goal is to create a game where every player will have a unique and fair experience.

## Community

We’re not just building a game; we’re building a community. Tricky Tactics is a journey we’re all taking together, and every step of the way, your feedback, your experiences, and your passion shape its future. Even in the early stages of the game's development, we were able to notice how talented our community is, they create drawings, fan concepts and much more, inspiring us to move forward!
