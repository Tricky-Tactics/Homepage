# About Us

TrickyTactics was founded in the midst of a deep void that plagued the auto battler genre. A community was in anguish over the loss of what could have been the next big auto chess titan from the makers of Brawl Stars and Clash of Clans: Clash Mini. From the ashes of one idea arose a new one: Why not make our own?

## A Game for the Players, by the Players
Inspired by Clash Mini, Tricky Tactics is the embodiment of that idea. From within the community, for the community, our goal is to create a labor of love that keeps players engaged and coming back for more every single day.

We believe in creating a game that is anti-predatory and accessible to all. Our vision is to craft an experience where both F2P and paying players can enjoy the game equally, driving our creative process every step of the way.

From playing games to making them, we prioritize the player above all else.

We’re not just building a game; we’re building a community. Tricky Tactics is a journey we’re all taking together, and every step of the way, your feedback, your experiences, and your passion shape its future.

Join us as we create something special, because in the end, this game is as much yours as it is ours.
